# Uncertainty Estimation for Audio Transcription Models

This repository contains the code, Jupyter notebooks, and experimental results from a research project focused on **uncertainty estimation in automatic speech transcription**, using **OpenAI Whisper** as the base model.

The main objective of the project is to evaluate and compare the performance of three uncertainty estimation methods:

1. **Monte Carlo Dropout**
2. **Temperature Scaling**
3. **Feature Densities**

Each method is implemented through structured Jupyter notebooks that include:

- Model loading (Whisper and variants)  
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Training or calibration steps  
- Evaluation on speech datasets  
- Metric computation (WER, correlations, calibration metrics)  
- Result visualization and comparison  

The repository is organized to support reproducible research and collaborative development among researchers and student assistants.
